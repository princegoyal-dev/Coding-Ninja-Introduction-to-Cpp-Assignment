WELCOME TO MY PRACTICE PROGRAMS 
LANGUAGE : C++
If you are cloning this repository, then no issue otherwise
For the programs having ONLINE_JUDGE
* MAKE an output file named output.txt
* MAKE an input file named input.txt
* Provide input in the input.txt
* Every cout/print statement you provide will reflect in the output file
* Other wise you can delete first seven lines of code from the main funtion of these programs, then you can run the program normally, those lines of code are as follows
    * ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    *  cin.tie(NULL);

    *  #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
    *  freopen("../input.txt", "r", stdin);
    *  freopen("../output.txt", "w", stdout);
    *  #endif
* Now you are ready to rock
